# Experience
I first started with little gimmicks in Javascript back in 5th grade. From there I started learning more, and it grew exponentially. I started modding games in Lua and coding robots in C. I also did a bit with Python, although I will say it is my least favourite language. I then moved on to C#, which was a more low-level language, and I immediately fell in love with it. However, still wanting to go deeper, I found C++. I've been using C++ for about a year now and it is by far my favourite, but it's also the most voliatile. This has trained me to find clever solutions and think out of the box, sometimes having to actively search for the issue and debug it. I've also pushed myself to use newer versions so I'll be ahead of the curve by the time it becomes standard.
