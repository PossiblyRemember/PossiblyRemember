I absolutely _LOVE_ low-level stuff and communicating directly with hardware. To go along with that, I also like taking this apart and somewhat jailbreaking them! In that sense, I'm essentially the literal definition of a hacker. I'll even break into my own stuff to learn about the inner workings and improve!
