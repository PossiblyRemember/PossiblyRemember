# Heya! Welcome to my profile!
## Interests
I like working on low-level projects and challenging myself to do as much manual for understanding, although I don't mind using frameworks. I love experimenting more than anything, really.
## Experience
I'm really focused on C++ right now for its performance and control capabilities. I've also done some things with Ghidra and creating/editing x86-64 NASM. My current project is a program for searching and potentially editing memory. Another hobby of mine is electrical projects, one of my most recent being rewiring a Kinect 360 to USB. Me and my dad also fix computers every now and then, which has rubbed off quite a bit on me.
## Community Service
Typically I'm the first person people come to with computer issues, and while a solid amount of them are simple and get fixed within 10 minutes, there are some that I do have to come over and do some work on. Recently I've fixed a Quest 2 and a computer with CPU issues, as well as fixed overheating problems with my own computer.
